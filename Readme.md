In the area of artificial intelligence, context is essential. Virtual assistants must understand user preferences, while financial tools require knowledge of market trends. Developers frequently employ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance an AI model's performance by obtaining relevant data. However, standard RAG may ignore critical context, resulting in incomplete answers.

In this post, we explore 'Contextual Retrieval,' an innovative approach that boosts retrieval accuracy through techniques like Contextual Embeddings and Contextual BM25. This method has significantly reduced retrieval failures. These developments greatly improve the effectiveness of AI applications.
